This is a good old classic game of snake! For those of you who don't know what snake is (where were you all your lives?!) its a one player game that allows you to control a snake around a screen to catch all of the food lying around to gain points!
In this game I added extra functionality to the original classic game.
I added EXTRA food so that there's FIVE foods:
An Apple, a Cherry, a Tomato, a Strawberry and a Rhubarb!
I've also added a count to the size of the snake as he munches more food.
I've made it so that the player gets 50 points fo EACH food eaten!
And finally I've added colour to the food, the snake, the scores, the canvas and the canvas background to make it a step up from the old greyscale classic Snake game!
